# Crack Width Calculator (IS 456:2000)
This repository provides a Python-based tool to estimate crack width in reinforced concrete members as per Annex F of IS 456:2000. 
It allows engineers, students, and researchers to understand and apply the formulae for serviceability limit state checks in flexural members.
## Features
- Calculates flexural crack width using standard IS 456:2000 formulas.
- Handles cracked section analysis with reinforcement and section properties.
- Provides options for:
  - Mean strain calculation
  - Distance from point of interest to bar (`acr`)
  - Variable cover and bar spacing
- Ideal for structural engineers, civil engineering students, and developers creating design tools.
